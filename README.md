# Week 4: Intro to JS Homework

There are four questions this week. You will need to declare variables, assign values, and combine the variables together in order to create a statement. 

The index.html file contains the questions and directions. Open up the file in your web browser. You do not need to edit the code on this file.
The exercises.js file is where you will be doing your homework. Declare variables, assign them values, and utilize the variables in order to create the answer statements.

If you are stuck, don't worry - Google is your best friend! If you still can't find what you are looking for, please reach out to us on Slack if you have any questions!
